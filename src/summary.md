This project helped me gain a good understanding of how microservices are used by various clients across different network concurrently. I focused on implementing my own version of RPC using java RMI. Below is a list of all the aspects that I used in the project.  

### Key Learning Points:

1. **Distributed Systems**: Got more comfortable distributed systems and how components interact across a network.

2. **Java Remote Method Invocation RMI**: Learned about Java RMI, which provides a high-level approach for remote method invocation in Java by encapsulating the network RPC protocols.

3. **Remote Procedure Call (RPC)**: Understood the concept of RPC, which allows a client program to call a procedure on another machine which may be in the same or different network.

4. **Inter-Process Communication**: Gained hands-on experience with IPC by implementing RPC between the client and the server.

5. **Network Communication**: While doing the research on different way to implement the project requirements, I got to learn about network protocols, serialization, and deserialization of objects to facilitate communication between components.

6. **Error Handling**: Developed error handling strategies to deal with exceptions and failures that can occur in a distributed environment, such as timeout exceptions, or absent resource exceptions.

7. **System Design**: Learnt how to design and implement a scalable distributed system by dividing functionality between server and client components.

8. **User Interface**: Enhanced my skills in designing a user interface for interacting with the distributed system.

9. **Locking Mechanism**: Leaned about Read Write Locks that are crucial while dealing with multiple concurrent clients that are trying to change the contents of any shared resource among them. 

10. **Multi Threading**: Understood the purpose and implementation of multithreading in a client server architecture of a distributed system.
